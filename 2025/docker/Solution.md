***Task 1:***


Introduction and Conceptual Understanding
Docker is an opensource centralised platform designed to create, deploy and run applications.
Docker uses container on the host os to run application it allows applications to use the some Linux kernal as a system on the best computer, rather than creating a whole vertual O.S.
Docker writen in 'go' Language
Docker is a tool that performs o.s. level virtualization also known as containerization.
Before Docker, many users faces the problem that a particular code is running in the developers system but not in the users system.

**Why is Docker Important in DevOps?**

Consistency: Docker ensures that your app works the same way everywhereâ€”whether you're developing, testing, or deploying it. No more "it works on my machine but not on the server" problems!

Lightweight & Fast: Unlike traditional virtual machines (VMs), Docker containers share the host system's OS kernel, making them smaller, faster to start, and more efficient.

Scalability: Docker makes it easy to scale your app up or down based on demand, which is perfect for modern apps built with microservices (small, independent services).

CI/CD Integration: Docker fits seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, automating the process of building, testing, and deploying apps. This speeds up software delivery and makes it more reliable.


**Virtualization vs. Containerization**

**Virtualization:**

Uses virtual machines (VMs) that include a full operating system.

Heavy on resources and slower to start.

Good for running different operating systems on the same hardware.

**Containerization:**

Uses containers that share the host OS kernel.

Lightweight, fast to start, and resource-efficient.

Perfect for microservices and CI/CD pipelines.

**Docker is Great for Microservices and CI/CD:**

Lightweight & Fast: Containers are small and start quickly, making them ideal for microservices (where you have many small, independent services).

Consistency: Docker ensures your app behaves the same way in every environment, reducing bugs and errors.

Scalability: You can easily scale individual microservices up or down as needed, saving resources.

Automation: Docker works well with CI/CD tools, automating the process of testing and deploying apps, which speeds up development.
